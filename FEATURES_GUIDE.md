# AI Assistant - Enhanced Features Guide

## New Capabilities

Your AI Assistant now has two powerful new features:

### 1. **Mathematics Problem Solver** 🧮

Solve complex mathematics problems including:

- **Algebraic Equations**: Solve for variables
  - Example: "Solve x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0"
  - Result: Gets all solutions

- **Calculus Operations**:
  - **Derivatives**: "Find the derivative of x^3 + 2x^2 + 5x"
  - **Integrals**: "Integrate 3x^2 + 2x + 1"
  - **Limits**: "Calculate limit of sin(x)/x as x approaches 0"

- **Polynomial Operations**:
  - **Factor**: "Factor x^2 - 5x + 6"
  - **Expand**: "Expand (x + 2)(x - 3)"
  - **Simplify**: "Simplify (2x^2 + 4x)/(2x)"

- **Systems of Equations**:
  - "Solve x + y = 5, 2x - y = 4"

#### How to Use:
Just ask a math question naturally:
```
"Solve the equation 2x + 7 = 15"
"What's the derivative of sin(x)?"
"Factor this polynomial: x^2 + 7x + 12"
"Simplify 3x^2/(x)"
```

The solver will:
1. Detect it's a math problem
2. Identify the operation type
3. Use SymPy to compute the solution
4. Return step-by-step results
